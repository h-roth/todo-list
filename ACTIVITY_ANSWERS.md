What can we identify about the requests from just the logs?

```

Our request to lists is slow!

[ ] üìù Open backend/cmd/root.go, and edit the Run function:

func Run(ctx context.Context, cfg *Config, logger*slog.Logger, stdout, stderr io.Writer) error {
    ...

    // Setup Tracing: Uncomment this block
    //shutdown, err := setupTracing(ctx, logger)
    //if err != nil {
    // return err
    //}
    //
    //defer shutdown()
    
    ...
You should find the block above. Uncomment the code to enable the tracing provider.

What is happening in the setupTracing function?

[ ] üìù Open backend/todo/routes/router.go, and edit the handler function:

func (m *mux) handler(method, route string, h http.Handler) {
    w := requestLog(h, m.logger, route)
    // Instrument HTTP Handlers: Uncomment the line below
    //w = otelhttp.NewHandler(w, method+" "+route)

    ...
You should find the block above. Uncomment the line containing otelhttp.NewHandler

How does this impact the handling of HTTP requests?
Why does this need to be applied here

Why are these requests taking so long?

n+1 problem, for each call to lists API, we make anothher call to the database for every list!

Several solutions, depending on the usecase we could:

* Perform a join in the database as one query
* Split the two database queries but perform one, then the next to get all lists
Essentially anything else that doesnt' involve one repo query calling another.
